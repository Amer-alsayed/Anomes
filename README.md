# Anomes

> A secure, anonymous Android messaging app powered by Tor and SQLCipher.

Anomes is a secure, anonymous messaging application built for Android using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It prioritizes user privacy and security by leveraging Tor for network anonymity and robust encryption standards for data storage and transmission.

## Features

- **Anonymous Communication**: Integrated with **Tor** (The Onion Router) to ensure network traffic analysis protection and anonymity.
- **Secure Encryption**: Utilizes industry-standard encryption protocols (Google Tink) to secure messages.
- **Encrypted Local Storage**: All local data is encrypted using **SQLCipher**, ensuring that your messages are safe even if your device is compromised.
- **Modern UI**: Built with **Jetpack Compose** (Material 3) for a fluid, responsive, and beautiful user interface.
- **Media Sharing**: Support for securely sending images and media.
- **QR Code Pairing**: Securely share contact information via QR codes using ZXing.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Kotlin
- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose (Material 3)
- **Network Anonymity**: Tor (via `tor-android` and `jtorctl`)
- **Database**: Room with SQLCipher
- **Image Loading**: Coil
- **Security**: AndroidX Security Crypto, Google Tink
- **Architecture**: MVVM
